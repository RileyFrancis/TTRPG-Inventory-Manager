# Architecture

How the code is arranged and why. This is the map; [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is the
detailed rationale — the reasoning behind each subsystem, and which parts are
load-bearing. Read this first, then that file for whatever you're about to touch.

## The shape of it

No framework, no bundler, no dependencies, no build step. Static files served
as-is. Everything below follows from that.

```
index.html              Static shell — every DOM element referenced by JS, with stable IDs
VERSION                 The app version, one line — bumped by hand
.env                    Firebase credentials for local dev (gitignored, optional)
.env.example            Template for .env
icons.html              Attribution for the icon set
src/css/                All styles, one file per concern
src/js/                 Application logic, one file per concern
data/
  items.csv             Default item database, loaded at startup
  item_dtypes.csv       Reference: the allowed values for each items.csv column
  classes.json          The classes the app knows, and the features each grants
  species.json          The species the app knows, and the traits each grants
  generic_items.csv     Reference data, not loaded
  items_old.csv         Reference data, not loaded
img/                    Image assets — the icon set and the paper texture
functions/
  firebase-env.js       Cloudflare Pages Function: serves the Firebase keys on a
                        deploy, from the host's environment variables
tools/
  shape-editor.html     Standalone helper for drawing item shapes
```

## Load order is behavior

The JS files are **classic scripts sharing globals — not ES modules**. There are
no `import`/`export` statements: a `function` or `const` at the top level of one
file is visible to every file after it, and each carries its own `'use strict'`,
since strict mode is per-script. Top-level code (element lookups,
`addEventListener` calls) runs at load time in file order.

So the `<script>` block at the bottom of `index.html` is the dependency order,
and changing it changes behavior. Adding a file means adding a tag there, in the
right position.

The same goes for `src/css/`: the `<link>` tags in `<head>` are in cascade
order, and reordering them is a cascade change. `tokens.css` must stay first —
it defines every colour and geometry custom property the other files read.

## The grid

- 15 columns fixed (`GRID_COLS`), rows = `strength × 3` — three equal zones:
  normal carry, encumbered, heavily encumbered.
- Cell size is 44px (`CELL`).
- `state.grid` is the authoritative occupancy map. The placed-item `<div>`s are
  purely visual and are rebuilt from it by `renderAllItems()`.
- **The grid can shrink under the items on it.** Strength going down takes rows
  away, and so does editing a container's interior size. `rebuildGrid()`
  fit-tests every instance before re-placing it and unplaces whatever no longer
  fits, which drops it into that grid's Needs Placement list.

Shapes are 2D arrays of `0`/`1`, and weight is the count of `1`s — 1 lb per
cell. Stackable items always use `[[1]]` and carry a `stackSize`: how many units
fit in that one cell, so each unit weighs `1 / stackSize`.

## Persistence

Four kinds of state, kept deliberately apart:

| What | Where | Synced? |
|------|-------|---------|
| The character roster — inventories, sheets, custom items | `localStorage`, `dnd_inventory_v1` | Yes, to `users/<uid>/save` |
| Browser furniture — theme, accent, panel widths, folders, sort order, sheet layout | One `localStorage` key each | Never |
| Party state — the roster, and everyone's shared view | Firebase, live | It *is* the sync |
| Shops | Firebase only | Not in the save file at all |

That split is the rule to preserve: anything describing *how this browser shows
the app* stays out of the save file, because a GM paging through the party must
keep their own arrangement rather than adopting each player's.

The save file's shape is version 2 — `{ version, activeCharacterId, characters }`.
Version 1 was a single character at the top level, and `normalizeSavePayload()`
folds one into a one-character roster; it is the only place that knows there were
ever two shapes. Only custom items are saved, since the defaults are re-hydrated
from `data/items.csv` on every boot.

Cloud save stores the whole save as **one JSON string**, not a tree: RTDB drops
nulls and empty objects, and the save file is full of both, so a tree write would
silently fail to replicate a deletion.

## Data files

`data/items.csv` is the default item database — one row per item, and **an
item's `id` is its row number**, so inserting a row above another changes its id.
Never write one into the code.

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `name` | Required — rows with a blank name are skipped |
| `rarity` | `common` \| `uncommon` \| `rare` \| `very_rare` \| `legendary` \| `artifact` \| `special` |
| `description` | Free text |
| `cost` | `15 gp`, `2 gp 5 sp`, … (a bare number is read as gp) |
| `tags` | Pipe-separated — `weapon\|melee\|finesse`; drives the sidebar tag filter |
| `damage`, `damageType`, `mastery` | Optional weapon fields |
| `attunement`, `container` | `true`, or blank for false |
| `stackSize` | How many units fit in one cell; blank or `1` means it does not stack |
| `shape` | Rows pipe-separated, each row 0/1 digits — `11\|01\|10` |
| `containerRows`, `containerCols` | Interior grid size for containers (blank = 5) |
| `properties` | Semicolon-separated — `Finesse; Light; Thrown` |
| `image` | Path to artwork, relative to the project root |
| `source` | Source material — `PHB`, `DMG`, `TCoE`, … ; `HB` (homebrew) for items the player adds in-app |

`data/item_dtypes.csv` lists the allowed values for every column and is the
reference to check against. `tools/shape-editor.html` draws a shape visually and
prints the `shape` string to paste in.

`data/classes.json` and `data/species.json` are the class and species
registries — `{ id, name, features: [...] }` and `{ id, name, traits: [...] }` —
read at load the same blocking way. Both are **content, not code**: adding a
class or a species should never mean a code change, and both files are already
the shape a user-authored one will take.

The character sheet's written sections (Backstory, Appearance) are Markdown, and
**raw HTML in them is allowed on purpose**. `src/js/markdown.js` is the only
place in the app that turns a string into markup, so its sanitizer is what keeps
one party member's backstory from running code in another's browser. Formatting
survives; anything that can execute, fetch or navigate does not.

## Theming

Two palettes, both defined as CSS custom properties in `tokens.css`: `:root`
holds the light (aged parchment) tokens, `:root[data-theme="dark"]` the dark
(candlelit) ones.

**Every colour is a token — never write a literal colour in a rule**, or it will
be wrong in one of the two themes. The single exception is the hue wheel in
`appearance.css`, which is not a themed surface but the spectrum itself.

- `<html data-theme>` is always `light` or `dark`, never unset. An inline script
  in `<head>` sets it before first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme.
- The accent colour is separately customisable per browser. What the user picks
  is a **hue and a saturation, never a lightness** — each theme supplies its own
  lightness, which is what keeps a custom colour readable on either ground.
- Rarity and coin colours differ per theme and are read out of CSS by JS. Any
  render path that bakes a palette colour into an inline style must be re-run
  from `rerenderThemedContent()` on a theme switch.

## Configuration

`firebase-config.js` reads `KEY=value` text from `.env` locally, or
`/firebase-env` on a deploy — first hit wins, and both are always tried, so
neither environment is locked out. When neither answers, `FIREBASE_CONFIG` is
`null` and the app runs fully offline with party play simply unavailable.
**Preserve that guard when touching party code.**

A missing file does not reliably 404: Cloudflare Pages answers unknown paths with
its index page, so a body starting with `<` is rejected as "not a config".

## Versioning

`VERSION` is one line at the project root, deliberately not in the source, so a
release bump never means editing code. `loadAppVersion()` in `main.js` fetches it
**asynchronously**, unlike `items.csv` and `.env` — nothing waits on it, so it
must not hold up the boot. A missing file leaves the Settings footer blank and
changes nothing else.
